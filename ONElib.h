OneSchema *oneSchemaCreateFromText (const char *text) ;

  // These functions create a schema handle that can be used to open ONEcode data files 
  //   for reading and writing.  A schema file is itself a ONEcode file, consisting of
  //   a set of objects, one per primary file type.  Valid lines in this file are:
  //      P <primary file type>   // a short string
  //      S <secondary file type> // a short string - any number of these
  //      O <char> <field_list>   // definition of object type - these are indexed
  //      G <char> <field_list>   // definition of group type - indexed and accumulate stats
  //      D <char> <field_list>   // definition of normal line type
  //   <char> must be a lower or upper case letter. By convention upper case letters are used
  //      for objects and records within objects, and lower case letters for groups and records not
  //      assigned to objects, including global and group information.
  //   <field_list> is a list of field types from:
  //      CHAR, INT, REAL, STRING, INT_LIST, REAL_LIST, STRING_LIST, DNA
  //      Only one list type (STRING, *_LIST or DNA) is allowed per line type.
  //   All the D lines following an O line apply to that object.
  //   By convention comments on each schema definition line explain the definition.
  //   Example, with lists and strings preceded by their length as required in ONEcode
  //      P 3 seq                            this is a sequence file
  //      O S 1 3 DNA                        the DNA sequence - each S line starts an object
  //      D Q 1 6 STRING                     the phred encoded quality score + ASCII 33
  //      D N 4 4 REAL 4 REAL 4 REAL 4 REAL  signal to noise ratio in A, C, G, T channels
  //      G g 2 3 INT 6 STRING               group designator: number of objects, name
  // The ...FromText() alternative writes the text to a temp file and reads it with 
  //   oneSchemaCreateFromFile(). This allows code to set the schema.

  //   the (hard-coded) schema for the header and footer, and the remainder each

  //   All header information (if present) is read.
  // 'schema' is also optional.  If it is NULL then the file must contain its own schema.  
  //   If 'schema' is present then it must support 'type', and if the file contains its 
  //   own schema, then that must match 'schema' where they share line types (there can be
  //   additional record types in both the file's schema, and in the argument 'schema').

  //   information is inherited from 'ofIn', where the count stats are from ofIn's 
  //   accumulation (assumes ofIn has been fully read or written) if 'useAccum is true,

  //   when the OneFile is closed, or if the program crashes.
  // If the path is a directory, then this creates a temporary file in the directory and
